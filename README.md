**Linked List Task Manager**

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to implement a Task Manager application using linked lists. The application should allow users to perform basic operations such as adding, deleting, and prioritizing tasks, demonstrating a practical understanding of linked list data structures.

**Requirements:**

1. **Task Node:**
   - Define a structure/class for a task node that includes attributes such as task name, description, priority, and due date.

2. **Linked List Implementation:**
   - Implement a linked list to store and manage the tasks.
   - Include functions/methods to insert a new task at the end, delete a task, and prioritize tasks based on user preferences.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Create a simple command-line or graphical user interface to interact with the Task Manager.
   - Provide options for users to add a new task, delete a task, and rearrange tasks based on priority.

4. **Basic Operations:**
   - Implement the following basic operations:
      - **Add Task:** Allow users to input details for a new task and add it to the linked list.
      - **Delete Task:** Enable users to delete a specific task from the list.
      - **Prioritize Tasks:** Implement a mechanism to rearrange tasks based on priority.

5. **Display Functionality:**
   - Include a function/method to display the list of tasks, showing relevant details such as task name, description, priority, and due date.

6. **User Interaction:**
   - Ensure a user-friendly interaction flow, guiding users through the process of adding, deleting, and prioritizing tasks.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to manage cases where tasks are not found for deletion or the list is empty.

**Implementation Guidelines:**

- Use a language of your choice (Python, Java, C++, etc.) to implement the Task Manager.
- Choose an appropriate approach for the user interface (command-line or graphical).
- Comment your code to explain the logic and functionality of each section.
